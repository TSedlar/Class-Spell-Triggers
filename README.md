## Examples
- When you or your target are poisoned/cursed/magic debuffed/diseased and have the applicable spell to cure the negative effect
- When you have buffs that should be up permanently and need to be renewed (lightning shield/water shield/battleshout/etc)
- When a spell is already used and would have no effect (totem already out)


## Compatibility
This addon is currently only supported on bartender 4, with plans to support the vanilla bar and others. (dominos, etc.)
